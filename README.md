# Parkour-Game
A parkour-driven game created in the Godot Game Engine. It is planned to have a complex, sliding boosted movement system similar to that of Warframe, but with more freedom of movement. If I finish this project, it will be the framework for a future FPS containing the movement seen in this game, however it needs to be perfected before I continue on with that project.
